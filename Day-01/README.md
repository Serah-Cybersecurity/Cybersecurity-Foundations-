# Day 01 – Cybersecurity Foundations: Environment Setup & Linux Basics

## Overview
Day 1 establishes the technical and mental foundation required for a career in cybersecurity. The focus is on setting up a realistic lab environment and developing initial Linux command-line competence, which is essential for security operations, incident response, threat detection, and system investigation.

Cybersecurity professionals frequently work in Linux-based environments where graphical interfaces are limited or unavailable. Mastery of the terminal is therefore a core, non-negotiable skill.

## Objectives
* Set up a functional cybersecurity lab environment
* Understand the role of Linux in cybersecurity
* Learn basic Linux command-line navigation
* Begin developing a security-focused mindset
* Document learning in a professional, auditable manner

---

## Lab Environment Setup

### Host System
* **Operating System:** Windows

### Virtualization
* Virtual Machine running on Windows host

### Guest Operating System
* **Parrot Security OS (Linux)**

### Why Parrot OS
Parrot OS is designed specifically for cybersecurity professionals. It includes built-in security tools, a hardened configuration, and a Linux environment similar to what is used in real-world security roles such as SOC analyst, threat hunter, and penetration tester. Using Parrot OS from the start ensures early exposure to industry-relevant tooling and workflows.

### Rooms Completed

#### 1. Introduction to Cyber Security
* Understand what is offensive and defensive security, and learn about careers available in cyber.
* **Key Concepts Learned:** Overview of cybersecurity domains, difference between defensive (blue team) and offensive (red team) roles, importance of foundational skills such as Linux and networking, and a high-level view of SOC and security operations.

#### 2. How The Web Works
* To become a better hacker it's vital to understand the underlying functions of the world wide web and what makes it work.


#### 3. Linux Fundamentals (Room 1)
* Many servers and security tools use Linux. Learn how to use the Linux operating system, a critical skill in cyber security.
* **Skills Covered:** Terminal interaction, navigation (`pwd`, `ls`, `cd`), file management (`touch`, `mkdir`, `rm`), and introduction to permissions (r, w, x).


#### 4. Windows Fundamentals
* Get hands-on access to Windows and it's security controls. These basics will help you in identifying, exploiting and defending Windows.
